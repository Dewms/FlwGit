            Getting that beautiful glowing skin you’ve always wanted has something to do with health and
        nutrition. As they say it—you are what you eat! So aside from sticking to your daily skincare
        regimen and regular beauty treatments at Flawless, give your body its required nutrients.
        \n\n
        Find foods that are rich in Vitamins A, C and E. Eat more dark green vegetables and fruits
        that are natural antioxidants, such as berries and apples. And don’t forget to drink lots
        of water.
        \n\n
        Adapt this healthy diet and you’ll definitely see and feel your skin glowing!

            We all know the wonders of workout for tightening the body, but what we should also consider
        (and make full use of) is our facial muscles. Exercising the facial muscles will help retain
        smoothness and firmness of the skin that results to a fresher and younger look. Now, here’s
        how you can do basic facial exercises:
        \n\n
        Forehead – Place your index and ring fingers above your eyes; while raising your eyebrows,
        pull your fingers down. Repeat 12 times.
        \n\n
        Cheeks –Purse lips inwardly as you inhale air into your mouth and then smile slowly and widely
        to stretch muscles. Repeat 10 times.
        \n\n
        Neck – Place your thumb and index finger in the middle of your chin, and then separate both
        fingers to massage the jaw and slowly move down to the neck. Repeat 12 times.
        </item>
        <item>Anti-age your lips naturally, here are 2 easy ways to get those younger, fuller and more kissable
       lips without surgery.
        \n\n
       Exercise.Save sagging lip muscles by pouting your lips and moving them upwards to the nose.
       Hold for 10 seconds and release slowly; repeat 12 times.
       \n
       To plump up lips, make a duck face or simply pout your lips widely and then kiss the back of
       your hand as if you’re giving your lips a push up. Repeat 12 times.
        \n\n
       Anti-oxidize.Antioxidants help repair tissues and promote cellular regeneration, which reduce
       appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. To get these beautiful benefits of antioxidants, use
       Lipaddict Anti-Aging and Nourishing Lip Plumper from ISKIN New York.Lipaddict delivers age
       defying, volumizing, moisturizing, healing and lip-enhancing actions for fuller and
       younger-looking lips.
        \n\n
       For best results, apply a good amount of Lipaddict Lip Plumper on clean and dry lips.
       Lip addict can also be used in the evening as night treatment.

            Laser Hair Removal promises instant removal of hair on various parts of the face and body,
        such as upper lip, underarms, legs and bikini line. This advanced aesthetic treatment may be
        safe and pain-free but there are still some basic rules in LHR that we should not forget, like
        \n\n
        •	Do not use makeup, lotion or deodorant over the area to be treated. This is to ensure
        effectiveness of the treatment and to avoid complications from chemicals found in such products.
        \n\n
        •	Do not pluck, wax or tweeze area for at least 4 weeks prior to the scheduled session.
        These traditional hair removal techniques cause skin to be extra sensitive to laser treatments.
        \n\n
        •	Avoid sun exposure for at least 7 days and wear sunscreen of high SPF level to protect
        skin from harmful UV rays; we recommend Flawless Skin Protect Mist with SPF 70.
        \n\n
        Note: Achieve hair-free perfection! Flawless offers lifetime packages on Laser Hair Removal.

    Is it true that beauty products formulated for Caucasians are not as effective when used by Asians?
    \n\n
    This is perhaps one of the most arguable subjects in the beauty industry today, and for good reasons.
    As more and more cosmeceutical companies both local and abroad look at our country as a viable market
    for their products, it has become much easier for the rest of us, 21st century simpletons, to find
    ourselves trapped in the middle of a fierce marketing battlefield where messages with somewhat contradicting
    information are regularly thrown.
    \n\n
    Some international cosmeceutical companies tend to apply the same science and principles that
    gave them success in western countries here in our region, says Dr. Evelyn San Luis, a Medical Aesthetic
    Professional at Flawless Face and Body Center (Flawless). Although not entirely a bad thing, this
    practice could pose major disadvantages for both these companies and their consumers primarily because
    of the fact that our skin is structured differently, and therefore, have dissimilar needs.
    \n\n
    Citing not only the difference between the composition of Asian and Caucasian skin, but also the
    external factors that affect our biggest organs condition, Dr. San Luis says that maintaining
    the optimum health and natural beauty of oriental skin calls for more specialized and thorough regimens.
    \n\n
    There are several factors that greatly affect the health and appearance of our skin, she explains.
    Clearly, we have a lot more on our plates. Compared to Caucasians, we have more sebaceous glands,
    larger melanin cells and a thicker epidermis. We are also more prone to darkening and pigmentation
    due to the fact that our skin has more melanocytes (mature, melanin-forming cells). Thats why its
    really comforting to know that there are now companies like ISkin New York who are into formulating
    beauty products that cater to our specific needs.
    \n\n
    Well renowned and a favorite brand especially among celebrities, ISkin New York is a leading provider
    of premium skincare programs that deal with various skin issues through the process of cell renewal;
    that is to say, product lines that initiate a chain reaction of cell rebirth from deep into the skin.
    Even more impressive, they also offer products that contain specialized peptides—chains of amino acids
    that perform specific functions like anti-aging and skin lightening agents. These specialized peptides
    allow everyone to enjoy the brand’s benefits for longer periods of time and without subjecting themselves
    to harmful chemicals.
    \n\n
    ISkin New York’s flagship program, the ISkin Transformation Kit, is designed with the Asian skin
    in mind. Its advanced formulation promises to increase the skins tolerance to environmental
    factors and diminish any visible sign of aging, including wrinkles, fine lines, pigmentations
    and rough skin. According to Dr. San Luis, the program is perfect for those who, due to their
    fast-paced lifestyle and constant exposure to free radicals, have skins that are aging faster
    than they should.
    \n\n
    Each individual product included in the ISkin Transformation Kit has been carefully blended and
    tested several times to ensure quality. They work deep into the skin to stimulate new cell
    growth, improve circulation and help rebuild collagen.
    \n\n
    ISkin’s Transformation Kit is composed of top-quality products that promise to bring out the best
    in your Asian skin. It includes: a mild plant-based deep cleanser that effectively removes dirt
    and other impurities without harming your skin; a balancing toner restores the skins pH balance—boosting
    its ability to absorb nutrients in preparation for the creams that will follow; a lightweight
    whitening moisturizer that targets pigmentations; a broad spectrum sunscreen that doesnt leave a
    greasy feel on the skin; and two patented rejuvenating creams that effectively stimulate cell
    activity and collagen and elastin formation.

    Looking for that one beauty treatment that answers all skin concerns? Or how about a treatment
    that brings skin vitality? Well, your search may be over.
    \n\n
    Flawless, the country’s preferred aesthetic clinic, introduces a technologically advanced aesthetic
    treatment that sheds light to all skin concerns—The Flawless Rejuvelite Mask Facial.
    \n\n
    Powered by LED technology, the Flawless Rejuvelite Mask Facial activates collagen production and
    boosts skin rejuvenation for total beauty. This treatment works by allowing the skin to absorb
    light energy to produce cellular fuel and increase activity of the body’s natural healing and
    regeneration processes.
    \n\n
    The Flawless Rejuvelite Mask Facial offers 7 different colors of visible light and infrared light
    to produce various benefits to the skin, such as firming lines, soothing skin, repairing damages,
    clearing acne and blemishes, reducing redness, and balancing complexion.
    \n\n
    These gorgeous effects depend on the wavelengths of light used, which is determined by color.
    Red and purple lights promote youthful beauty; red combats wrinkles and increases collagen
    production for a smoother, younger-looking skin, while purple increases cell regeneration and renewal.
    For damaged and irritated skin, cyan and yellow lights are useful for healing as cyan calms and soothes
    irritated skin and reduces swollen capillaries, and yellow alleviates redness and heals skin from
    inflammation, sunburn, windburn and other environmental damages.
    \n\n
    Earlier this year, Flawless CEO and owner, Rubby Sy-Coyiuto announced that more beautiful things are
    coming to the beauty brand as they launched their new look and logo to the public, and the Flawless
    Rejuvelite Mask Facial is just one of them.
    \n\n
    “Flawless’ humble beginnings started by bringing aesthetic services within the reach of the mass
    through facials,” says Rubby. “And what better way to introduce a new treatment, than to make a
    technologically advanced facial service available to everyone.”
    \n\n
    Flawless offers The Flawless Rejuvelite Mask Facials in 4 full variants, Flawless Rejuvelite Oil
    Control Mask Facial, Flawless Rejuvelite Acne Control Mask Facial, Flawless Rejuvelite Age Defy
    Mask Facial, and Flawless Rejuvelite Whitening Mask Facial, for P1,100 per session.
    \n\n
    For those who are looking for a quick yet effective aesthetic treatment, also available are Flawless
    Rejuvelite InstaFacials for express Calming, Boosting, Healing, and Firming effects at P480 per session.
    Each Flawless Rejuvelite InstaFacial only takes 30 minutes—suitable for the busy beauty seekers.

    `That`s why we make sure to return the favor by giving them what want and deserve on National Flawless Day.`
    \n\n\n

    each year, Flawless releases a nationwide promo highly anticipated by their beauty patrons.
    \n\n\n
